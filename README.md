<b> About </b>
In assignment I used a GIPHY APi to make a dynamic webpage that populates with gifs with an outdoor theme. 
In this assignment I called the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and JQuery to change the HTML of the website page. 

<b> Requirements </b>
* To create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a varaible called topics. 

* The app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML. 

* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. 

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

* Under every gif, display its rating (PG,G, so on).
  - The data is provided bt the GIPHY API. 

* Add a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page. 

<b> Techologies used </b>
